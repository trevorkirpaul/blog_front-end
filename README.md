# Blog
## following my experience as a new professional web developer

This is a long term project that was inspired by a "downtime" project for my job. It will be a blog detailing my life and experience and I embark on this exciting new journey. I've also always wanted a blog to keep track of my thoughts as well as improve my writing and communication of ideas.


__Backend:__ RoR

__Frontend/view:__ React

__Database:__ Postgres

I also plan on using Redux. I know this is a simple blog but I'll be tracking much more than one model. Regardless of the need, though, I would use Redux just to keep the learning experience going. I'll also be using redux-saga.

The main purpose of this project is to continue my learning through execution as well as this being a "downtime" task for work. Initially, blog posts(any db info really) will not be public as to prevent any NDA issues.
